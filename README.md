Created a website that curates a comprehensive list of companies visiting our college. The website features a chatbot to address repetitive and frequently asked questions, and each company listing links to seniors who have been placed in that company. This project aims to provide students with accurate guidance and preparation resources tailored to each company.
This website is a hub of inspiration and guidance, curated to empower students like you to reach for the stars and land your dream job in top multinational corporations.
